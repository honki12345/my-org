* core java
** About This eBook
** Preface
*** To the Reader
I assume that you don't like books filled with toy examples
My goal(writer) is to enable you to fully understand the Java language and library

This first volume concentrates **on the fundamental concepts** of the Java language
The second volume, *Core Java, Volume 2: Advanced Features*, goes further into the most import libraries

*** A Tour of This Book
*** Conventions
*** Sample Code
** Acknowledgments
** An Introduction to Java
*** Java as a Programming Platform
Java is a whole *platform*, with a huge library, containing lots of reusable code, and an execution environment that provides services such as security, portability across operating systems, and automatic garbage collection
*** The Java "White Paper" Buzzwords
**** simple
The syntax for Java is, indeed, a cleaned-up version of C++ syntax
**** object-oriented
**** distributed
**** robust
**** secure
**** architecture-neutral
**** portable
**** interpreted
**** high-performance
**** multithreaded
**** dynamic
*** Java Applets and the Internet
*** A Short History of Java
*** Common Misconceptions about Java
** The Java Programming Environment
how to install JDK
how to compile
how to run Java programs
*** Installing the Java Development Kit
**** Downloading the JDK
depending on the provider, the Java Development Kit may have a brand name, such as Temurin(Eclipse Foundation)

**** Setting Up the JDK

*** Using the Command-Line Tools
The compiler requires a *file name*(~Welcome.java~). When you run the program, you specify a *class name*(~Welcome~) without a ~.java~ or ~.class~ extension
*** Using an Integrated Development Environment
*** JShell
** Fundamental Programming Structures in Java
*** A Simple Java Program
Java *is case sensitive*
if you made any mistakes in capitalization, the program will not run

The keyword ~public~ is called an *access modifier*
these modifiers control the level of access other parts of a program have to this code

everything in a Java program lives inside a class

you need to make the file name for the source code the same as the name of the *public class*, with the extension ~.java~ appended
**** name of the class
class names are nouns that start with an uppercase letter
Names must begin with a letter, and after that, they can have any combination of letters and digits
The length is essentially unlimited
You cannot use a Java reserved word(such as ~public~ or ~class~)
**** main method
According to the Java language Specification, the ~main~ method must be declared ~public~`
The Java Language Specification is the official document that describes the java language

~main~ method does not return an "exit code" to the os
If the ~main~ method exits normally, the java program has the exit code ~0~ indicating successful completion
To terminate the program with a different exit code, call ~System.exit(code)~.
